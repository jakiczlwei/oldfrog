        <p>You may wonder, 'Why did u make this website. Theres already a oldfrog.org discord'.</p>
        <p>The oldfrog discord dosent even talk much about oldfrog. I made this web so that oldfrog players can discuss diferent topics.</p>
        <p>Our discord that we do not recommend to join,<b> btw join it, its the only place where u can talk lmao</b><p/>
        <p>If there is a problem with the website, want to give feedback or have any questions, contact me on discord: <b>frobi#2440</b></p>
